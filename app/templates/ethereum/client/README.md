# client
This is the client folder.

### Requirements
* node 10.15+
* npm 6.4+ or yarn 1.2+

We recomend yarn as it's faster, securer and works offline. And obviously because we provide a *yarn.lock* file.

## Folder structure

* public
    * there are only public static files in here, like html, css, images, icons, etc
* src
    * pages
        * all pages js/jsx code
    * utils
        * some util function

## Development
**Don't forget that** it's necessary to deploy the blockchain app first. See the [ethereum readme](../ethereum/README.md).
```
$ yarn
$ npm run start
```
