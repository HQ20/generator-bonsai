# <%= title %> README

Welcome to your main "<%= title %>" readme. From this file you should get enough information to start working with the code generated by our friend *Yeoman*.

## A bit further

Without getting it to long, depending on what you want to do, a good readme will help your project having a better image. This is not readme example or template, so search on the internet for one.


## Important notes

A few packages used here are *eslint*, *esdoc*, *solidity-coverage* and *solium*. Some might not agree with these dependencies.

### For more information
