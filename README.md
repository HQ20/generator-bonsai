Bonsai is *"an Asian art form using cultivation techniques to produce small trees in containers that mimic the shape and scale of full size trees"* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonsai)

This generator mimics the shape of a big project. As we come along we had to rebuild the same over and over, so we decided to create a generate to help us.

It allows you to generate a frontend boilerplate as well which can be either in javascript or typescript.
